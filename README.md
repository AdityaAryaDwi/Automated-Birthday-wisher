# Automated-Birthday-wisher
This Python project automates birthday wishes by checking a CSV file for upcoming birthdays, sending personalized emails to individuals whose birthdays match the current date using SMTP services. Leveraging Pandas for data manipulation, the script reads and filters birthday data based on the current date. It dynamically selects a random letter template and customizes it with the recipient's name. This demonstrates proficiency in data handling, automation, and integration of external services. The project showcases practical application skills in scripting and problem-solving, providing an automated solution for birthday greetings
